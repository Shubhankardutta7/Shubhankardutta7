A quick learner, enthusiastic team player, and ability to work in challenging environments. I also possess good interpersonal skills that help me work well with clients and teams. My hobbies include listening to music and watching documentaries, traveling and interacting with different people. My goal is to become a valuable asset in an organization where my hard work can be recognized and appreciated resulting in growth. Currently working with Amazon as Software Development Engineer.

I take pride in writing "clean" code than "overly-smart" code.
